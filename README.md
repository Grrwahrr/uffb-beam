# UFFB Beam - Interactive Text Art Installation

An immersive 3D text experience created for the **Ukrainian Film Festival Berlin (UFFB) 2025**. This interactive art installation renders floating words in 3D space, creating a poetic and contemplative environment that reflects themes of conflict, survival, everyday life, and human resilience.

## üé≠ About the Installation

UFFB Beam transforms words into a living, breathing digital space where text moves through three-dimensional depth. Visitors can interact with the installation by contributing their own words, which become part of the ever-evolving narrative landscape.

The installation features four thematic word collections:
- **Conflict and Survival**: fence, border, sky, drone, siren, distance, refuge, broken, gone, safe
- **The Everyday**: university, home, window, elderberry, hand, laundry, morning, neighbor, family, sleep  
- **Presence and Perception**: see, breathe, wait, hold, remember, silence, moment, space, time, near
- **Emotional Undercurrent**: alone, waiting, grief, tenderness, courage, care, loss, return, belong, pause
